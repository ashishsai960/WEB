            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            <p class="p">Cooking is one of the strongest cermonies for life. when recipes are put together, the kitchen is a chemical laboratory involving
                air,fire,water and the earth. This is what gives values to humans and elevates their spiritual qualities. if you take a frozen box and stick it in the 
                microwave, you become connected to the factory
